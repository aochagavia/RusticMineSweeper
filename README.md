Rustic Mine Sweeper
==================

A basic implementation of the Mine Sweeper game using the Rust programming language. To build it you will need the latest nightly build of the compiler.


##Why?

Because I needed an excuse to program something in Rust, and I had an old mine sweeper in C++ that screamed to be rewritten.


##How to play?

You will get the instructions printed in your console when you run the game.


##How is the source organized?

In the src directory there is a README.md with information about that.


##Hey! Something is wrong in your code!

Then you can open a pull request. I promise I will look at it!
